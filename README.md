This package will search through a specific page inside the [Knowledge and Opinion](https://theodi.org/knowledge-opinion/) section of the ODI website and scrape the data from the page. It will then return an array of objects containing the data from the page. It will then clean the results so that they can be uploaded to database platforms such as Airtable, Nocodb and MongoDB.

To run the function simply add the number of pages you would like to scrape.
